- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

## Summary

My first milestone was assembling the base of the robotic arm so that I could test it and make sure that the Arduino Nano, the Arduino Shield, the first servo, and the batteries were all working properly. It was also so I could test uploading the code from the Arduino software to the Arduino Nano to make sure that it was all connected properly

## Components used

- 1 Arduino Nano: Controls all the servos
- 1 Arduino Shield: Receives power from batteries and hooks up to all the wires
- 1 USB cable: Receives signals and power from laptop
- 1 Servo: Rotate the base of the arm
- Wooden Cutouts: Creates the bulk of the physical part of the base
- Batteries: Powers everything
- Wires: Connects everything to electricity
- Velcro: Holds the battery holder in place
- Screws, nuts, and columns: Secures all the parts to each other
- Turntable: Uses a ball bearing to allow the base to rotate 360 degrees

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge that I faced was when I was assembling the base, I kept screwing in the wrong servo arm into the hole where it is supposed to go. So when I realized my misteake, I would have to take apart half the base just to put in the right servo arm. The screws that kept the servo arm in place were also super tiny so it was really hard getting them in and out. And I actually put the wrong servo arm in twice before I got the right one in.

## Next Steps

I plan on completeing the physical part of my robotic arm so that I can control it with a controller using joysticks. To control the servos that will move the arm.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)

## Summary 

My starter project was the BlueStamp Arduino Starter. There is an Arduino Uno Board and Arduino Shield stacked on top of each other and they are connected to a breadboard with a circuit where a red LED light lights up when you press a button. It is meant to have one input of my choice: a switch, button, pressure sensor, and much more. And one output of my choice could be a motor or a light. The Arduino Uno Board came pre-built and I just had to connect wires to it, but I had to solder all the parts onto my Arduino Shield to build it. 

## Components used

- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 USB A->B cable
- 1 Arduino Proto Shield
- 1 Breadboard
- 3 Buttons
- 3 LEDs
- 4 Resistors
- 2 Ceramic Capacitors
- 2 8-pin female 0.1" headers (1*6)
- 5 5-pin female 0.1" headers (1*8)

##  Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge that I faced was trying to build the circuit on the breadboard and Arduino Uno becuase I had never done anything like it before so I didn't fully understand how a breadboard worked and how to make it so that I could put multiple circuits on one breadboard so that they would both work but not interfere with each other. Another challenge was mounting the Arduino Proto Shield onto the Arduino Uno because I had soldered the female pins on but they were a little bit offset so the female and male pins would not fit together. I had to resolder it all so that they would line up.

## Next Steps

I plan to start on my main project, the Phone-Controlled Robotic Arm. I have to build the arm, create a Bluetooth connection between the arm and the phone, and code the arm so that the phone can make the arm work remotely.
